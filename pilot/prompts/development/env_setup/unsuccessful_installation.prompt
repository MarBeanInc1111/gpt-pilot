Great! To install the {{ technology }} on your machine, we'll need to run some commands. I'll provide you with the commands, and you can let me know the output you receive. If a command is successful, I'll provide you with the next command to run. If a command is unsuccessful, I'll try to suggest a solution to resolve the issue before moving on to the next command.

Command 1: Check if you have the necessary system requirements to install {{ technology }}. Run the following command:

<system requirements check command>

Please provide me with the output.
