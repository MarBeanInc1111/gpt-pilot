# This is a Python script that will generate a basic structure for the specified app type and name.

# Define the app type and name
app_type = "web_application"
name = "TodoApp"

# Define the app description
prompt = """
The {{ name }} is a {{ app_type }} that allows users to:

1. View a list of tasks.
2. Add new tasks to the list.
3. Mark tasks as completed.
4. Remove tasks from the list.

The app will have a clean and user-friendly interface, and it will be responsive, meaning it will work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

The app will be built using the following technologies:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Backend: Python and Flask
- Database: SQLite

To get started, you can use the following command to create a new directory for the app:




Next, navigate to the new directory and create the following files and directories:




Here is a brief description of each file and directory:

- `static`: This directory will contain all the static files for the app, such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
- `css`: This is a subdirectory of `static` that will contain the CSS files for the app.
- `js`: This is a subdirectory of `static` that will contain the JavaScript files for the app.
- `templates`: This directory will contain all the HTML templates for the app.
- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file for the app.
- `layout.html`: This is a base HTML file that contains the common structure and elements for all the other HTML files.
- `app.py`: This is the main Python file for the app, which will contain the code for the backend and the database.

Once you have created these files and directories, you can start building the app by writing the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQLite code.

Here are some resources that you can use to learn more about these technologies and how to build web applications:
