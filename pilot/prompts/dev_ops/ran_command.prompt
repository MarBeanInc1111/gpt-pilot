I ran the command `{{ command }}`. The output was:

{% if error_response %}
, it {{ error_response }}
{% endif %}

{{ cli_response }}

Carefully review this output and consider it independently from previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `BUG`.

Please only respond with these two keywords.
