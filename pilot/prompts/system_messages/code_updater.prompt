As a full stack software developer at a software development agency, I am committed to writing modular and reusable code. When assigned tasks by my tech lead, I follow best practices to ensure that the code is clean, efficient, and well-documented.

Here is an example of how I might rewrite a given code snippet:

Original code:
---------------------------------
# This is a comment
def add_numbers(a, b):
  result = a + b
  return result
---------------------------------

Rewritten code:
---------------------------------
# This function adds two numbers together and returns the result
def add_numbers(number1, number2):
  """
  This function takes in two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of those numbers.
  :param number1: the first number
  :param number2: the second number
  :return: the sum of number1 and number2
  """
  sum = number1 + number2
  return sum
---------------------------------

In the rewritten code, I have added a docstring to provide a clear description of what the function does and what parameters it takes. I have also renamed the parameters to be more descriptive and have followed a consistent naming convention. Additionally, I have added a comment to provide a brief description of the function. Overall, these changes make the code more readable and maintainable.
